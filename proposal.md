* Complet Summary (1 1/2-2p)

The long and complicated history of cigarette marketing and youth culture \cite{AhluSmit18, GilmFook15, PerkArmo18, RibiDAng17}  provides a cautionary tale, suggesting that it is important to prepare to protect the interests of children in a society where cannabis is legalized.

================================
# Quality of the Idea (1/2-1p)

- To establish data system to identify and characterize new segments of potential cannabis-using populations and address
substance abuse issues such as attitudes and initiation of cannabis use during adolescence.  Cannabis initiation during adolescence might develop negative consequences in adulthood \cite{MeieCasp12, WintLee08}.  By identifying risk groups of the adolescence, any earlier exposure will inform the ethology of cannabis abuse.

- - Our survey questionnaire was based on Ontario Students Drug Use and Health Survey (OSDUHS), a survey of secondary school students in Ontario since 1977 to ensures the reliability of the data to be collected.  Our survey will include six main fields:  knowledge, attitudes, risk perception, social cannabis climate, risk behavior and use (KARSRU).  The survey will also allow us to investigate correlation of cannabis use with other items, such as alcohol and cigarette; as indicated that alcohol misuse could be a proxy for vulnerabilities to substance use or lack of cultural prohibitions against .\cite{KerrBae17}.  The data we will collect from surveys via questionnaire and social media and focus groups are expected to provide a good quality of information on adolescents and behaviour of cannabis consumption for public health policy on recreational cannabis law (RCL) reform and early prevention.

-  A gap of anticipating impact of cannabis legalization on adolescent cannabis use and its actual impact exists.  One main reason behind RCL was its less proposed harmful effects on health \cite{Cox18}, especially compared to cigarette \cite{ChasPres96, MeleThom18}.  After the legalization, the message of cannabis as for “recreation” might promote the use.  Our study will provide a good quality of data to mitigate the gap by collecting data in April, 2019, not long after the cannabis legalization in October, 2018.

- As far as we are aware of, our study represent limited previous research. While focusing on adolescent and cannabis, our study will also analyze associations and comparison of cannabis and cigarette in attitudes and social climates via analysis of survey, social media and focus group.  We hope that various methodical approaches will provide detailed information for effective cannabis reform and prevention campaign.

The project will build on ongoing work in analyzing social determinants of cannabis consumption behaviour – including cannabis knowledge, social climate and socio-economic factors – and combine it with rigorous statistic tools to untangle the complexity of cannabis consumption environment. The overall objective is to provide information that can be used to better develop early onset prevention intervention programs of adolescent use of cannabis for health impacts and pubic safety in Canada.

================================
# Importance of the Idea (2-3P) (background and prevalence, impact of cannabis on youth:), why is ours important

Canada entered an unexplored territory of recreational cannabis use in October, 2018 when Cannabis Act commenced (https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/news/2018/06/backgrounder-the-cannabis-act-the-facts.html).  The Act would shift positions of cannabis consumption from criminal prohibition to harm minimization and public health and safety.  As proposed that the Cannabis Act was implemented based on limited peer-reviewed and evidence-baed research, public sentiment and other similar regulatory frames \cite{Cox18, Kala16},  how adolescent and other vulnerable groups respond to a cannabis environment once RCL comes into force warrants studies of its effect on health in any forms (for example, see \cite{BudnBoro17, CaulKilm12, DudoPere17, LakeKerr16, Kala16, KerrBae17}.   We focus on adolescent in our proposal because they are at a unique stage of life in developing their characteristics and values \cite{ChriVine05}.  It is a public health interest to understand their values, interest and development for health economy and social ecology.

Evidence-based studies on cannabis effects on health are far from conclusive \cite{Cox18, Kala16, Nati17} with few accepted standards for safe use or health effects reached \cite{HannPere17, Nati17, SiliHorw18}.  Yet, a general anticipation of adolescent cannabis consumption is that early onset of cannabis use during adolescence might precipitate negative consequences  \cite{LynkHall00, LopePere11, MeieCasp12,  SiliHorw14, VolkBale14}.  For example, Cannabis use can develop dependence \cite{LopePere11}, and persistent cannabis use was associated with neuropsychological decline and cognitive problems \cite{MeieCasp12}.  

There is abundant of research on initiation and prediction prevention protection on youth substance use and that has laid the groundwork for RCU study \cite{Nati17}, yet social structural analysis of adolescent’s intention and initiation of cannabis use \cite{AhluSmit18, BelcShin98, DiNa09} is relatively limited compared to therapeutic effects (e.g., addiction, anxiety, depression and physiological impacts) \cite{Nati17}.  Due to the relatively noble era of RCL, there is limited research investigated initiation and intention of cannabis use and comparison of the change before and after the legalization.   We proposed to use sophisticated statistical methods to analyze socialstruturual factors of knowledge, attitude, risk perception, social cannabis climate and intention of initiation about cannabis consumption (KARSIC) of adolescent.

A recent detailed report of the health effects of cannabis and cannabinoids, based on evidence-based review and research agenda, by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine provided detailed findings \cite{Nati17}.  Some of the main conclusion on problem cannabis use include:  first, there is a substantial evidence of a statistical association between increases in frequency of cannabis use and the likelihood of problem cannabis use; second, there is a substantial evidence of a statistical association between being male and the severity of problem cannabis use; third, there is also substantial evidence that cannabis use initiation at an earlier age is a risk factor for developing cannabis problem use, and last, gender and smoking cigarettes are risk factors for the progression of cannabis use. \cite{Nati17}.  Because of the information we proposed to gather in terms of students targets and data content, this research can provide important information for RCL reform in general, and particular in Canada.  Our findings can also be important for further psychosocial analysis (e.g., cognition, academic achievement and social relationships) and bridge the gap between cannabis use behaviours and effects among children.
 
Cannabis use was the highest type of illicit drugs consumed by grade 7-12 students in the 2017 OSDUHS.  In Ontario, 19% of students grade 7-12 reported using cannabis in the previous year and 21.6% ever used during lifetime based on the 2017 Ontario Student Drug Use and Health report and the prevalence was similar to the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance data of the United States, which showed that 19.8% of students grade 9-12 reported current marijuana use (with 30 days before the survey), and 35.6% had used cannabis during their life  in 2017 \cite{KannMcMa18}.  Both data suggest a similar prevalence among high school children and a noticeable portion of the students as early onset users.  Cannabis use was strongly associated with alcohol consumption and tobacco cigarette smoking showed in OSDUHS \cite{SampHamil18}.  As RCL may lead to increase in adolescents initiating cannabis, it may also be the first choice before other types of substance such as alcohol and tobacco because of changes in social norms regarding cannabis use \cite{FairFurr18} and perceived as less harmful drugs \cite{MorgNoro13, Nati17}.  Yet, using cannabis first before other substance may likely increase the chance of heavy use and cannabis use disorder (CUD)  \cite{FairFurr18}, and early onset of cannabis user before age 18 are also more likely to develop a CUD \cite{WintLee08}.   One study analyzing cross-sectional surveys of US students from 1991-2014 show that perceived harmfulness of cannabis has decreased significantly since 1991 within the background when many states passed medical cannabis law between 1996-2014 \cite{KeysWall16}; although in a similar study, the results showed that an increase in adolescent cannabis use was not clearly associated with decreases in cannabis risk perceptions \cite{SarvWall18a}.


Understanding intention and behaviour of using cannabis can provide effective intervention frames for early onset prevention.

Why KARSIC:
Knowledge: legislation
Attitude:
Risk perception:
Social cannabis climate:  The most common access to obtain cannabis was from friends among Ontario students in 2016 \cite{BoakHamil17}
Intention of initiation:
Cannabis consumption

Cannabis industry has sought cooperation with drink (alcohol and soft drinks) industry (e.g., Canopy Growth Corp 
partners with Constellation)

The effects of RCL on youth attitudes and behaviour, and eventually on their mental and physical health will be difficult to predict. The long and complicated history of cigarette marketing and youth culture provides a cautionary tale, suggesting that it is important to prepare to protect the interests of children in a society where cannabis is legalized.  As discussed above, until different results of studies of cannabis use after RCL \cite{}, its effects on physiological health \cite{}, adherence and cessession \cite{}mental health \cite{} among others can be explained, it is urgent to develop evidence-based research results to reform RCL that the adolescent health and safety under the Cannabis Act in Canada are under protection and early onset prevention intervention is proposed.

The negative impacts of alcohol and cigarette on health have been accepted.  It is reasonable to propose that cannabis could be a top choice among those alcohol, cigarette and other illicit products because of its legalization and the less obvious harm \cite{FairFurr18}. According to the Cannabis Legalization and Regulation in Canada (http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/cj-jp/cannabis/), it would be
legal for individuals aged 18 or older to "purchase cannabis online from federally-licensed producers," "grow, from licensed
seed or seedlings, up to 4 cannabis plants per residence for personal use" or "make cannabis products, such as food and drinks, 
at home".  Under these terms, surveillance on youth over online purchase or homegrown cannabis will be challenging.

When characterizing adolescent vulnerability, identifying subgroups of adolescents at high risk for addictive behaviors is a major goal of the addiction field.
 
 ================================
# Approach (5p)

Once recreational cannabis is legalized, public perceptions will change in ways that will affect the social perceptions of youth, 
potentially leading to new social pressures. These images and pressures could have substantial negative impact on youth mental and physical health. We will conduct surveys via questionnaire and social media and focus groups to gather data on high school students in Hamilton, focusing on how youth perceive the cannabis in the social context: their knowledge, attitudes, risk perception, intention of initiation and behavior related to cannabis use. Surveys will be conducted in person (at school) and via Instagram. The questionnaire will cover  four broad topics: socio-demographic variables; cannabis environment (logistics, social media and social network);  knowledge and attitudes; consumption behavior and motivation.


## Research Question:


1. How are youth knowledge, attitudes, risk perception and cannabis climate (KARRCU) about cannabis
structured by social interactions and by outside information?

2. How are knowledge, attitudes, risk perception and cannabis climate affecting and affected by cannabis
consumption?

RCL is expected to influence cannabis use by adolescents and young adults in particular, and by those with a inclination of substance use.

2. How are knowledge, attitudes, risk perception and cannabis climate affecting and affected by risk behaviours of cannabis
consumption?

4. How does these process differ between adolescents whose initial cannabis use was before the legalization and those after?
(How are these processes affected by the changing legal situation?)
	
	— We will analyze this questions by 
	— We will also compare our results with the findings of OSDUHS 2017 report.  The OSDUHS 2017 report presented data before the cannabis legalization, when a time of speculation and anticipation of legalizing cannabis use.  Our data will present data with one year of the legalization. 


The fundamental concepts of the research questions were based on how risk perpection and social norms associate with 
intentional



## Data Sources

(We have to apply for a permit from the HWDSB (http://www.hwdsb.on.ca/about/research/)to conduct surveys
* Samples:
There are fourteen secondary schools (grade 9-12) in Hamiton, Ontario (http://www.hwdsb.on.ca/secondary/schools/) 
with about 3,300 grade 9 students (http://www.hwdsb.on.ca/blog/high-school-graduation-rate-continues-to-rise/). 
We will sample about 1,400 students to get a 95% of confidence interval.

We will also conduct 5-6 in-depth focus groups research with 8-10 participants in each group.  We will randomly select schools to 
participat and recruit students from school clubs in the selected schools.
schools.

- sampling methods and questionnaires, see \cite{BlevAbra18***, BrouDuff11, DudoPere17, SuSupp16}, and **Health Behaviour in School-aged Children in Canada: Focus on Relationships at
(http://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/publications/science-research-sciences-recherches/health-behaviour-children-canada-2015-comportements-sante-jeunes/index-eng.php)

* Data Collections:
We plan to collect data from two main sources:  in-depth focus group, and questionnaire surveys.  The questionnaire surveys will
include in person distribution and online instagram.

For focus group, we will (not randomly) select participants from school clubs (or from instagram volunteers?) or randomly seelct
from each school (?).
 - focus group data: The information collected from the focus groups will be coded by trained coders under 3-step coding 
 process based on ground theory.  The coders will discuss and review the materials until a kappa>0.8 is reached for all 
 the major themes.  The analysis will be conducted using computer software (see\cite{DudoPere17}.
 - colloboration of data collection:  online (instagram survey), cell phones, school board etc

- social media: 
 -- why social media:  \cite{CurtLook18, YooYang16}
		“social media function as an effective communication channel for generating, sharing, receiving, and commenting on smoking-related content and are thus influential on college students' smoking.” \cite{YooYang16}
	— media \cite{LinNeil09, MorgSarg13} and social influences \cite{}.
 -- why instagram, see http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018/  It's the most 
used social media (next to youtube) by adolescent in 2018. also\cite{ThomRiva15}

* Questionnaire Designs:
— Need to add questions to survey:  
	- cannabis stores; 
	- images of people smoking cannabis (vs. smoking cigarrate.)
	- health impact:  physiological, mental, addiction
	- risk perception (from \cite{AposFieu06}
	- cannabis legalization:  is it legal now?

We designed the survey questionnaires based on the modules of national and international health surveys on adolescents, 
such as 2013/14 HEALTH BEHAVIOUR IN SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION COLLABORATIVE CROSS-NATIONAL 
SURVEY's HBSC International Protocol, 
 - cannabis risk perception questionnaire, see \cite{ParkAnth18}

It will be great if we can conduct two surveys, one year apart, to investigate grade 8 and when they turn grade 9.  It is not
a cohort, but give us some quasi-prospect studies to see the differences not long after the legalization and one year later.

* Measurements and Concepts 
(KARSU:  knowledge, attitude, risk perception, social climate and use)
Knowledge:  \cite{AdlaPagl00, MaurSant18,SpacHain17} (more):  is it legal?  where to buy? Can you grow it at home?
Attitudes (intention and willingness to try): \cite{RustWest18}
Risk perception:  \cite{SarvWall18a, SpacHain17}
Social climate: \cite{Duff11, RavnDuff15, ShiCumm18}, distance of cannabis stores from school (or home), parents and friends use \cite{RusbWest18}  and alcohol use \cite{KerrBae17}
U


Knowledge and attitudes will be measured by the aggregregation of correct answers in the section of knowledeg and attitudes 
in the survey.
Control covariates included individual, and school characteristics.

Ethics approval was obtained from McMaster Univeristy (Hamilton, Ontario), and from Hamilton-Wentworth District School 
Board.  Written parental consent will be obtained, and students will provide assent to participate in the study
on the day of the survey. For dditional details, please see Supplemenary......

## Analytical Methods

* Statistical analysis
We will apply factor analysis to the survey data to analyze the relationships between knowledge, attitudes and behaviour, and how these are affected by covariates (school, student background, etc.). Focus group answers will be coded by multiple coders. We will then apply grounded theory to sort the ideas into concepts and categories that will illuminate the quantitative findings from the surveys.

## Application

## Challenges

- Self report of risk behaviors might be subject to socially desirable response bias tend to be underestimated \cite{BrenBill03}
- Our study is planned based on a one-year grant, we will not be able to conduct a follow-up survey to investigate the differences 
of how legalization may make for the same grades students in 2019 and in 2020.  We hope to find resources to continue the semi-project
study to gather more evidence-based results of legalation and consumption behaviors among adolescent.

## Transition
We will make our findings useful by 
- initiating meetings with the hamilton school district boards and principles to share our results.  
- initiating meeting with the Althernative for Youth, the Hamilton branch to share our restulsts for feedbacks and further cooperation.
- sharing our results with the Canada Public Health bureau
- sharing our resutls, especially our survey modules with the research team of Canadian HEALTH BEHAVIOUR IN SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION COLLABORATIVE CROSS-NATIONAL SURVEY to their reference.
- sharing our results with the medical community of adolescence and health, especially in substance use.
- sharing our results on instagram.
- publishing our results at peer-review journals
- to attending public forum and encourage the discussion of cannabis use and adolescent.
- It took decades of works by various communities to move and fight against tobacco consumption among adolescents; it may take as much to work on cannabis ……



We wish to meet with the groups mentioned above for feedback for further studies.
We wish to bridge the knowledge gap concering adolescent marijuan consumption behavior and their risk perception for implementing 
effective and supportive environment and services.
