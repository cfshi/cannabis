# Importance of the Idea

-- What happened in Europe on treating youth cannabis users \cite{RigtPelc10}
-- legal issues and impact on user disorder, and compared to cigarate and alcohol in US  \cite{BoroBudn18,BudnBoro17}
-- critique of legalization in Canada \cite{Kala16}***
-- associatin of leglaization and teen use of cannabis \cite{CerdWall17}***
-- association of risk perception and use are not concluded \cite{SarvWall18}
-- "Cannabis liberalization with depenalization and partial prohibition policies was associated with higher levels of regular cannabis use among adolescents. The correlations were heterogeneous between genders and between short- and long-terms." \cite{ShiLenz15}

# Approach

## Research Questions
- physical health questions

- mental health questions
 -- "intense use of high doses of cannabis over many years, and the initiation of cannabis use in adolescence, can be associated with substance dependence (DSM-5; ICD-10), specific withdrawal symptoms, cognitive impairment, affective disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders, and physical disease outside the brain (mainly respiratory and cardiovascular conditions)" \Cite{HochBonn15}
 -- "depressive symptoms and cannabis use-related problems are generally indicative of cannabis withdrawal severity, whereas craving specifically predicts cannabis withdrawal during an active attempt to cut-down cannabis use." \cite{CousvanD18}
 -- "legalization has contributed to the continuing normalization of cannabis, validation of its consumption, and greater access to a host of new and more potent THC products by adolescents." \cite{SorbGorg16}

- social and cultural questions
 -- peer pressure \cite{Tuckdela17}
## Data Sources
