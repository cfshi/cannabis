1. Summary (2p)
a. Background and Importance: Provide a brief overview of relevant background information and/or rationale for the proposed 
research. 

Knowledge, attitudes and risk perception and climate of recreatioal cannabis law (RCL) is public health interest and it may liely
affect behavior of consuming cannabis.  As cannabis legalization approaches, it is vital to learn more about the physiological and mental health impact of cannabis
on youth. The effects of legalization youth attitudes and behaviour, and eventually on their mental and physical health will
be difficult to predict. The long and complicated history of cigarette marketing and youth culture provides a cautionary tale,
suggesting that it is important to prepare to protect the interests of children in a society where cannabis is legalized.

Once recreational cannabis is legalized, public perceptions will change in ways that will affect the social perceptions of youth, 
potentially leading to new social pressures. These images and pressures could have substantial negative impact on youth 
mental and physical health. We will conduct focus groups and surveys to gather data on high school students in Hamilton, 
focusing on how youth perceive the cannabis in the social context: their knowledge, attitudes, motivations and behavior 
related to cannabis use. Surveys will be conducted in person (at school) and via Instagram. The questionnaire will cover 
four broad topics: socio-demographic variables; cannabis environment (logistics, social media and social network); 
knowledge and attitudes; consumption behavior and motivation.

We focus on adolescent in our study because they are at a unique stage of life in developing their characteristics and 
values \cite{ChriVine05}.  It is a public health interest to understand their values, interet and development for health
economy and social ecology.



b. Goal(s) / Research Aims: Indicate the broad goal(s) and specific research aims of the proposed research and clear
linkage indicating how they fit the objectives of the funding opportunity.  

c. Methods / Approaches / Expertise: Provide a brief
overview of the methodology and population that will be used to address each of the research aims. This section may also 
include the nature of the core expertise being brought together to address the proposed research. Information may include 
important collaborations (within or outside of the research community) that will be accessed to achieve the outlined research 
goals.  

We will supplement our survey findings with information available from the Canadian Health Measures Survey, and the Health 
Behaviour in School-aged Children Study.

d. Expected Outcomes:  Describe the expected outcomes of the proposed research highlighting the significance of the proposed
research and how it will advance knowledge and/or its application to health care, health systems and/or health outcomes.


This study will provide valuable information on how youth perceive cannabis, how these perceptions are changing, 
and how these perceptions affect their behaviour and, potentially, their health.

* Complete Summary:

# Goals

# Background
The landscape of cannabis availability and use in Canada has rapidly changed in Canada after its legalization in October 2017.
Studies of associations of cannabis legalization and uses provided mixed results and the different findings yet need to be 
explained \cite{Kala16}. While there are mixed findings of cannabis effect on health overall, limited studies in adolescent and 
their preception and movitation of cannabis consumption \cite{} and conclusive agreements yet to be reached \cite{}.

Cannabis effect on adolescent are documented in its impact on brain development \cite{}, education attainment \cite{}, mental
anxiety \cite{} and likelihood of expanding the use and of extention of other drugs \cite{}.

# Specific Aims

- To identify volnerable target groups \cite{HochBonn15}
- 

# Expertise

# Outcome

=======================================
* Complete Application

# Quality of the Idea

- To establish data system to identify and characterize new segments of potential cannabis-using populations and address
substance abuse issues such as initiation of cannabis use during adolescence

# Importance of the Idea
Background:  Why adolescent and cannabis?  
Studies of cannabis associating with adolescdnts range from brain development, attention disorder, legalization affect 
etc.. but few studies on adolecent knowledge, attitudes and preference of cannabis consumption (OK, explain why is it important.)
-- national surveys:  USA \cite{LipaArhn17, MaurNews17}, Canada \cite{AdlaPagl00, SpacHain17}, Australia \cite{YapReav12}, Youth in Ontario \cite{SampHami18}
 --- "There were no statistically significant increases in past-year MUD prevalence for any age or gender group after MML 
 enactment. " \cite{MaurNews17}; international surveys \cite{BogtSchm06, terBdeLo14}
-- What happened in Europe on treating youth cannabis users \cite{RigtPelc10}
-- legal issues and impact on user disorder, and compared to cigarate and alcohol in US  \cite{BoroBudn18,BudnBoro17, CerdSarv18, JohnJohn17}
-- legalization:
 ---critique of legalization in Canada \cite{Kala16, LakeKerr16}***
 --- effects of legalization in California \cite{CaulKilm13}te{RustWill18}, in US cite{BoroBudn17} 
 --- legal medical marijuana:  "passage of state medical marijuana laws does not increase adolescent use of marijuana... 
 adolescent use is higher in states that ever passed such a law than in other states" \cite{HainWall15}
-- associatin of leglaization and teen use of cannabis \cite{CerdWall17,}*** No correlation \cite{RusbWest18, ShiCumm18}
-- association of risk perception and use are not concluded \cite{SarvWall18a}
-- "Cannabis liberalization with depenalization and partial prohibition policies was associated with higher levels of regular cannabis use among adolescents. The correlations were heterogeneous between genders and between short- and long-terms." \cite{ShiLenz15}
-- Social media and commercials can not be banned and censored on social media:  youtube \cite{KrauSowl17, MongYock18},
alcohol related-social media and alcohol consumption \cite{CurtLook18}
-- education attainment \cite{LynkHall00}, 
- motivation: \cite{PachLimi18}:"although cross-sectional evidence of a cannabis-specific effect on motivation is equivocal,
there is partial support from longitudinal studies for a causal link between cannabis use and reduced motivation. "
- effects:  Adverse Health Effects of Marijuana Use \cite{SiliHorw14, VolkBale14}
- parents:  feeling disempowered and unsupported when dealing with kids' cannabis issue in Canada \cite{HainMict18}
- perception of risk and drive cannabis use:  \cite{ParkAnth18}
- cognition:  \cte{}

According to the Cannabis Legalization and Regulation in Canada (http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/cj-jp/cannabis/), it would be
leagl for individuals aged 18 or older to "purchase cannabis online from federally-licensed producers," "grow, from licensed
seed or seedlings, up to 4 cannabis plants per residence for personal use" or "make cannabis products, such as food and drinks, 
at home".  Under these terms, surveillance on youth over online purchase or homegrown cannabis will be challenging.

# Research Question:

1. How are youth knowledge and attitudes (KA) about cannabis
structured by social interactions and by outside information?

2. How are knowledge and attitudes affecting and affected by cannabis
consumption?

3. How are these processes affected by the changing legal situation?


# Approach

The fundamental concepts of the research questions were based on how risk perpection and social norms associate with 
intentional

## Research Questions
- physical health questions
 -- brain development by gender \cite{HeitHard18}, health by gender \cite{ChenMart18, HammGull16, Kuhn15} (is cannabis use a substance use?)
 -- "cannabis use leading to other illicit drug use and of an association between cannabis use and psychosis." \cite{HannPere17}
 -- continuity of using drugs:  
  --- "youth have been increasingly likely to use marijuana as their first drug and sequence of initiation is associated with race/ethnicity, 
  gender, and age. Using marijuana first might increase the chance of heavy use and CUD."\cite{FairFurr18}
 -- ohters \cite{CastPing17}
- mental health questions:  effects on metal health (e.g. depression and bipolar) are mixed and not concluded \cite{HannPere17, 
SiliHorw18}
 -- "intense use of high doses of cannabis over many years, and the initiation of cannabis use in adolescence, can be 
 associated with substance dependence (DSM-5; ICD-10), specific withdrawal symptoms, cognitive impairment, affective 
 disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders, and physical disease outside the brain (mainly respiratory
 and cardiovascular conditions)" \Cite{HochBonn15}
 -- "depressive symptoms and cannabis use-related problems are generally indicative of cannabis withdrawal severity,
 whereas craving specifically predicts cannabis withdrawal during an active attempt to cut-down cannabis use." \cite{CousvanD18}
 -- "legalization has contributed to the continuing normalization of cannabis, validation of its consumption, and greater
 access to a host of new and more potent THC products by adolescents." \cite{SorbGorg16}
 -- "Regular (particularly daily) adolescent cannabis use is associated consistently with anxiety, but not depressive disorder,
 in adolescence and late young adulthood, even among regular users who then cease using the drug. It is possible that early 
 cannabis exposure causes enduring mental health risks in the general cannabis-using adolescent population." \cite{DegeCoff13}
 no associaiton of depression and cannabis use: "Depression and welfare dependence were not significantly associated with 
 adolescent cannabis use after adjustment. This finding is consistent with previous reviews, which concluded that the 
 effect of cannabis use on these psychosocial outcomes could plausibly be explained by..." \cite{SiliHowr18}:
 -- knowledge:  adult vs youth \cite{MaurSant18}
 -- others: \cite{DegeCoff13, GuttSkin18} 

- social and cultural questions
 -- peer pressure \cite{Tuckdela14} and social norm \cite{DudoPere17***, EiseToum14, SuSupp16}, binge drinking leading to other risk
 behavior \cite{MillNaim07}
 -- social network:  \cite{Duff13**, DuncRien16, JeonGood13}
 -- minority:  sexual minority \cite{DermMars16}, Natives \cite{StanSwai17}, ethnicity \cite{FishZapo17, ZapoFish17}, 
 - gender: \cite{ChamSlad17, MahaLomb15, TuRatn09}

## Data Sources

(We have to apply for a permit from the HWDSB (http://www.hwdsb.on.ca/about/research/)to conduct surveys
* Samples:
There are fourteen secondary schools (grade 9-12) in Hamiton, Ontario (http://www.hwdsb.on.ca/secondary/schools/) 
with about 3,300 grade 9 students (http://www.hwdsb.on.ca/blog/high-school-graduation-rate-continues-to-rise/). 
We will sample about 1,400 students to get a 95% of confidence interval.

We will also conduct 5-6 in-depth focus groups research with 8-10 participants in each group.  We will randomly select schools to 
participat and recruit students from school clubs in the selected schools.
schools.

- sampling methods and questionnaires, see \cite{BlevAbra18***, BrouDuff11, DudoPere17, SuSupp16}, and **Health Behaviour in School-aged Children in Canada: Focus on Relationships at
(http://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/publications/science-research-sciences-recherches/health-behaviour-children-canada-2015-comportements-sante-jeunes/index-eng.php)

* Data Collections:
We plan to collect data from two main sources:  in-depth focus group, and questionnaire surveys.  The questionnaire surveys will
include in person distribution and online instagram.

For focus group, we will (not randomly) select participants from school clubs (or from instagram volunteers?) or randomly seelct
from each school (?).
 - focus group data: The information collected from the focus groups will be coded by trained coders under 3-step coding 
 process based on ground theory.  The coders will discuss and review the materials until a kappa>0.8 is reached for all 
 the major themes.  The analysis will be conducted using computer software (see\cite{DudoPere17}.
 - colloboration of data collection:  online (instagram survey), cell phones, school board etc

- social media: 
 -- why social media:  \cite{CurtLook18}
 -- why instagram, see http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018/  It's the most 
used social media (next to youtube) by adolescent in 2018. also\cite{ThomRiva15}

* Questionnaire Designs:
We desgined the survey questionnaires based on the modules of national and international health surveys on adolescents, 
such as 2013/14 HEALTH BEHAVIOUR IN SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION COLLABORATIVE CROSS-NATIONAL 
SURVEY's HBSC International Protocol, 
 - cannabis risk perception questionnaire, see \cite{ParkAnth18}

It will be great if we can conduct two surveys, one year apart, to investigate grade 8 and when they turn grade 9.  It is not
a cohort, but give us some quasi-prospect studies to see the differences not long after the legalization and one year later.

* Measurements and Concepts 
(KARCU:  knowledge, attitude, risk perception, cannabis climate and use)
Knowledge:  \cite{AdlaPagl00, MaurSant18,SpacHain17} (more)
Attitudes (intention and willingness to try): \cite{RustWest18}
Risk perception:  \cite{SarvWall18a}
Climate: \cite{Duff11, RavnDuff15, ShiCumm18}, distance of cannabis stores from school (or home), parents and friends use \cite{RusbWest18}
U


Knowledge and attitudes will be measured by the aggregregation of correct answers in the section of knowledeg and attitudes 
in the survey.
Control covariates included individual, and school characteristics.

Ethics approval was obtained from McMaster Univeristy (Hamilton, Ontario), and from Hamilton-Wentworth District School 
Board.  Written parental consent will be obtained, and students will provide assent to participate in the study
on the day of the survey. For dditional details, please see Supplemenary......

## Analytical Methods

## Challenges

- ESelf report of risk behaviors might be subject to socailly desirable response bias tend to be underestimated \cite{BrenBill03}
- Our study is planned based on a one-year grant, we will not be able to conduct a follow-up survey to investigate the differences 
of how legalization may make for the same grades students in 2019 and in 2020.  We hope to find resources to continue the semi-propect
study to gather more evidence-based results of legalation and consumption behaviors among adolescent.

## Transition
We will make our findings useful by 
- initiating meetings with the hamilton school district boards and principles to share our results.
- initiating meeting with the Althernative for Youth, the Hamilton branch to share our restulsts for feedbacks and further cooperation.
- sharing our results with the Canada Public Health bureau
- sharing our resutls, especially our survey modules with the research team of Canadian HEALTH BEHAVIOUR IN SCHOOL-AGED CHILDREN
WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION COLLABORATIVE CROSS-NATIONAL SURVEY to their reference.
- sharing our results with the medical community of adolesence and health, especially in substance use.
- sharing our resutls on instagram.
- publishing our results at peer-review journals
- 



We wish to meet with the groups mentioned above for feedback for further studies.
We wish to bridge the knowledge gap concering adolescent marijuan consumption behavior and their risk perception for implementing 
effective and supportive environment and services.
