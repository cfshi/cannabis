Background:
-- national surveys:  USA \cite{LipaArhn17, MaurNews17}, Canada \cite{SpacHain17}, Australia \cite{YapReav12}
 --- "There were no statistically significant increases in past-year MUD prevalence for any age or gender group after MML 
 enactment. " \cite{MaurNews17}
-- What happened in Europe on treating youth cannabis users \cite{RigtPelc10}
-- legal issues and impact on user disorder, and compared to cigarate and alcohol in US  \cite{BoroBudn18,BudnBoro17}
-- critique of legalization in Canada \cite{Kala16}***
-- associatin of leglaization and teen use of cannabis \cite{CerdWall17}***
-- association of risk perception and use are not concluded \cite{SarvWall18}
-- "Cannabis liberalization with depenalization and partial prohibition policies was associated with higher levels of regular cannabis use among adolescents. The correlations were heterogeneous between genders and between short- and long-terms." \cite{ShiLenz15}
-- Social media and commercials can not be banned and censored on social media:  youtube \cite{KrauSowl17, MongYock18}
-- education attainment \cite{LynkHall00}, 
- motivation: \cite{PachLimi18}:"although cross-sectional evidence of a cannabis-specific effect on motivation is equivocal,
there is partial support from longitudinal studies for a causal link between cannabis use and reduced motivation. "

# Approach

## Research Questions
- physical health questions
 -- brain development by gender \cite{HeitHard18}, health by gender \cite{HammGull16, Kuhn15} (is cannabis use a substance use?)
 -- "cannabis use leading to other illicit drug use and of an association between cannabis use and psychosis." \cite{HannPere17}
 -- ohters \cite{CastPing17}
- mental health questions
 -- "intense use of high doses of cannabis over many years, and the initiation of cannabis use in adolescence, can be 
 associated with substance dependence (DSM-5; ICD-10), specific withdrawal symptoms, cognitive impairment, affective 
 disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders, and physical disease outside the brain (mainly respiratory
 and cardiovascular conditions)" \Cite{HochBonn15}
 -- "depressive symptoms and cannabis use-related problems are generally indicative of cannabis withdrawal severity,
 whereas craving specifically predicts cannabis withdrawal during an active attempt to cut-down cannabis use." \cite{CousvanD18}
 -- "legalization has contributed to the continuing normalization of cannabis, validation of its consumption, and greater
 access to a host of new and more potent THC products by adolescents." \cite{SorbGorg16}
 -- "Regular (particularly daily) adolescent cannabis use is associated consistently with anxiety, but not depressive disorder,
 in adolescence and late young adulthood, even among regular users who then cease using the drug. It is possible that early 
 cannabis exposure causes enduring mental health risks in the general cannabis-using adolescent population." \cite{DegeCoff13}
 -- others: \cite{DegeCoff13} 

- social and cultural questions
 -- peer pressure \cite{Tuckdela14} and social norm \cite{EiseToum14, SuSupp16}, 
 -- minority:  sexual minority \cite{DermMars16}, Natives \cite{StanSwai17}, ethnicity \cite{FishZapo17, ZapoFish17}
 
## Data Sources

- survey data
- focus group data:  Do we invite smaples who use/used cannabis for in-depth interview? (Is it legal for sample under certain age?)
- colloboration of data collection:  online, school board etc
- sampling (see SuSupp16)
