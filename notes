# Goals

# Background
The landscape of cannabis availability and use in Canada has rapidly changed in Canada after its legalization in October 2017.
Studies of associations of cannabis legalization and uses provided mixed results and the different findings yet need to be 
explained \cite{Kala16}. While there are mixed findings of cannabis effect on health overall, limited studies in adolescent and 
their preception and movitation of cannabis consumption \cite{} and conclusive agreements yet to be reached \cite{}.

Cannabis effect on adolescent are documented in its impact on brain development \cite{}, education attainment \cite{}, mental
anxiety \cite{} and likelihood of expanding the use and of extention of other drugs \cite{}.

# Specific Aims

- To identify volnerable target groups \cite{HochBonn15}
- 

# Expertise

# Outcome

=======================================
* Complete Application

# Quality of the Idea

- To establish data system to identify and characterize new segments of potential cannabis-using populations and address
substance abuse issues such as initiation of cannabis use during adolescence

# Importance of the Idea
Background:  Why adolescent and cannabis?  
Studies of cannabis associating with adolescdnts range from brain development, attention disorder, legalization affect 
etc.. but few studies on adolecent knowledge, attitudes and preference of cannabis consumption (OK, explain why is it important.)
-- national surveys:  USA \cite{LipaArhn17, MaurNews17}, Canada \cite{AdlaPagl00, SpacHain17}, Australia \cite{YapReav12}, Youth in Ontario \cite{SampHami18}
 --- "There were no statistically significant increases in past-year MUD prevalence for any age or gender group after MML 
 enactment. " \cite{MaurNews17}; international surveys \cite{BogtSchm06, terBdeLo14}
-- What happened in Europe on treating youth cannabis users \cite{RigtPelc10}
-- legal issues and impact on user disorder, and compared to cigarate and alcohol in US  \cite{BoroBudn18,BudnBoro17}
-- legalization:
 ---critique of legalization in Canada \cite{Kala16}***
 --- effects of legalization in California \cite{CaulKilm13}te{RustWill18}
-- associatin of leglaization and teen use of cannabis \cite{CerdWall17}***
-- association of risk perception and use are not concluded \cite{SarvWall18}
-- "Cannabis liberalization with depenalization and partial prohibition policies was associated with higher levels of regular cannabis use among adolescents. The correlations were heterogeneous between genders and between short- and long-terms." \cite{ShiLenz15}
-- Social media and commercials can not be banned and censored on social media:  youtube \cite{KrauSowl17, MongYock18}
-- education attainment \cite{LynkHall00}, 
- motivation: \cite{PachLimi18}:"although cross-sectional evidence of a cannabis-specific effect on motivation is equivocal,
there is partial support from longitudinal studies for a causal link between cannabis use and reduced motivation. "
- effects:  Adverse Health Effects of Marijuana Use \cite{SiliHorw14, VolkBale14}
- parents:  feeling disempowered and unsupported when dealing with kids' cannabis issue in Canada \cite{HainMict18}
- perception of risk and drive cannabis use:  \cite{ParkAnth18}

According to the Cannabis Legalization and Regulation in Canada (http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/cj-jp/cannabis/), it would be
leagl for individuals aged 18 or older to "purchase cannabis online from federally-licensed producers," "grow, from licensed
seed or seedlings, up to 4 cannabis plants per residence for personal use" or "make cannabis products, such as food and drinks, 
at home".  Under these terms, surveillance on youth over online purchase or homegrown cannabis will be challenging.

# Research Question:

1. How are youth knowledge and attitudes (KA) about cannabis
structured by social interactions and by outside information?

2. How are knowledge and attitudes affecting and affected by cannabis
consumption?

3. How are these processes affected by the changing legal situation?


# Approach

## Research Questions
- physical health questions
 -- brain development by gender \cite{HeitHard18}, health by gender \cite{ChenMart18, HammGull16, Kuhn15} (is cannabis use a substance use?)
 -- "cannabis use leading to other illicit drug use and of an association between cannabis use and psychosis." \cite{HannPere17}
 -- continuity of using drugs:  
  --- "youth have been increasingly likely to use marijuana as their first drug and sequence of initiation is associated with race/ethnicity, 
  gender, and age. Using marijuana first might increase the chance of heavy use and CUD."\cite{FairFurr18}
 -- ohters \cite{CastPing17}
- mental health questions
 -- "intense use of high doses of cannabis over many years, and the initiation of cannabis use in adolescence, can be 
 associated with substance dependence (DSM-5; ICD-10), specific withdrawal symptoms, cognitive impairment, affective 
 disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders, and physical disease outside the brain (mainly respiratory
 and cardiovascular conditions)" \Cite{HochBonn15}
 -- "depressive symptoms and cannabis use-related problems are generally indicative of cannabis withdrawal severity,
 whereas craving specifically predicts cannabis withdrawal during an active attempt to cut-down cannabis use." \cite{CousvanD18}
 -- "legalization has contributed to the continuing normalization of cannabis, validation of its consumption, and greater
 access to a host of new and more potent THC products by adolescents." \cite{SorbGorg16}
 -- "Regular (particularly daily) adolescent cannabis use is associated consistently with anxiety, but not depressive disorder,
 in adolescence and late young adulthood, even among regular users who then cease using the drug. It is possible that early 
 cannabis exposure causes enduring mental health risks in the general cannabis-using adolescent population." \cite{DegeCoff13}
 -- knowledge:  adult vs youth \cite{MaurSant18}
 -- others: \cite{DegeCoff13, GuttSkin18} 

- social and cultural questions
 -- peer pressure \cite{Tuckdela14} and social norm \cite{DudoPere17***, EiseToum14, SuSupp16}, 
 -- social network:  \cite{DuncRien16, JeonGood13}
 -- minority:  sexual minority \cite{DermMars16}, Natives \cite{StanSwai17}, ethnicity \cite{FishZapo17, ZapoFish17}, 
 - gender: \cite{TuRatn09}
 
 - comparing the results to the national data:

## Data Sources

- survey data
- focus group data:  Do we invite smaples who use/used cannabis for in-depth interview? (Is it legal for sample under certain age?)
- colloboration of data collection:  online (instagram survey), cell phones, school board etc
- sampling methods and questionnaires, see \cite{BlevAbra18***, BrouDuff11, DudoPere17, SuSupp16}, and **Health Behaviour in School-aged Children in Canada: Focus on Relationships at
(http://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/publications/science-research-sciences-recherches/health-behaviour-children-canada-2015-comportements-sante-jeunes/index-eng.php)
- social media: why instagram, see http://www.pewinternet.org/2018/05/31/teens-social-media-technology-2018/  It's the most 
used social media (next to youtube) by adolescent in 2018. also\cite{ThomRiva15}
- interviewting retailers:  how often they encounter individual under 18?
- cannabis risk perception questionnaire, see \cite{ParkAnth18}

It will be great if we can conduct two surveys, one year apart, to investigate grade 8 and when they turn grade 9.  It is not
a cohort, but give us some quasi-prospect studies to see the differences not long after the legalization and one year later.

## Statistical Methods

## Challenges

- Self report of risk behaviors tend to be underestimated \cite{BrenBill03}
- Negotiation with schools for distributing questionnaires can be challenging
- 

## Transition
We will make our findings useful by 
- initiating meetings with the hamilton school district boards and principles to share our results.
- initiating meeting with the Althernative for Youth, the Hamilton branch to share our restulsts for feedbacks and further cooperation.
- sharing our results with the Canada Public Health bureau
- sharing our results with the medical community of adolesence and health, especially in substance use.
- sharing our resutls on instagram.
- publishing our results at peer-review journal

We wish to meet with the groups mentioned above for feedback for further studies.
We wish to bridge the knowledge gap concering adolescent marijuan consumption behavior and their risk perception for implementing 
effective and supportive environment and services.
