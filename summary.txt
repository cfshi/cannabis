Summary
=======

As cannabis legalization approaches, it is vital to learn more about the physiological and mental health impact of cannabis on youth. The effects of legalization youth attitudes and behaviour, and eventually on their mental and physical health will be difficult to predict. The long and complicated history of cigarette marketing and youth culture provides a cautionary tale, suggesting that it is important to prepare to protect the interests of children in a society where cannabis is legalized.

Once cannabis is legalized, public perceptions will change in ways that will affect the social perceptions of youth, potentially leading to new social pressures. These images and pressures could have substantial negative impact on youth mental and physical health. We will conduct focus groups and surveys to gather data on high school students in Hamilton, focusing on how youth perceive the cannabis in the social context: their knowledge, attitudes, motivations and behavior related to cannabis use. Surveys will be conducted in person (at school) and via Instagram. The questionnaire will cover four broad topics: socio-demographic variables; cannabis environment (logistics, social media and social network); knowledge and attitudes; consumption behavior and motivation.

We will supplement our survey findings with information available from the Canadian Health Measures Survey, and the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children Study.

This study will provide valuable information on how youth perceive cannabis, how these perceptions are changing, and how these perceptions affect their behaviour and, potentially, their health.
