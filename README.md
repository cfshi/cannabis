# Title:  
Knowledge, attitudes and behaviour patterns underlying cannabis consumption among youth in Hamilton, Ontario

# Objective

To understand the following areas of high school students to establish core and pressing need for a comprehensive frame for further research and identify mechanism for policy decision:
- knowledge of cannabis
- attitudes of cannabis
- movitation and behaviors of using cannabis now and in the future and people around them
- cannabis vs. cigarate vs. drugs

It will provide baseline information of risk communication to potential users/targets 

# Introduction

- a bit of history of cannabis in general medically, culturally and legally
- current stage of legalizing cannabis
- vs. the history of cigarate and youth

# Summary:

As cannabis legalization approaches, it is vital to learn more about the physiological and mental health impact of cannabis on youth.  The effects of  legalization youth attitudes and behaviour, and eventually on their mental and physical health will be difficult to predict.  The long and complicated history of cigarette marketing and youth culture provides a cautionary tale, suggesting that it is important to prepare to protect the interests of children in a society where cannabis is legalized.

Once cannabis is legalized, public perceptions will change in ways that will affect the social perceptions of youth, potentially leading to new social pressures.  These images and pressures could have substantial negative impact on youth mental and physical health.  This project, will conduct focus groups and surveys to gather data on high school students in Hamilton, focusing on how youth perceive the cannabis in the social context:  their knowledge, attitudes, motivations and behavior related to cannabis use.  Surveys will be conducted via schools and Instagram.  There are four parts of the questionnaire:  socio-demographic, cannabis environment (logistics, social media and social network), knowledge and attitudes, and consumption and motivation.  The measurements of self-evaluation of academic performance and friendship will also be included in the socio-demographic measurement.

We will construct statistical models to analyze while controlling for spatial and socio-demographic effects.  We also plan to compare the results to Canadian Health Measure Survey, and Health Behaviour in School-aged Children in Canada to investigate the difference before and after the legalization of cannabis.

We plan to conduct focus groups which will provide us valid information for questionnairs design.  We will conduct random samples among the Hamilton school district for the surveys.  We will analyze the data using statistics to understand the sample's socio-demographic background, for examples, gender, and their overall perspectives of the cannabis.  

This study will provide valuable information on how youth perceive cannabis and how these perception affect their behaviour and, potentially, their health.


# Research Questions


1. How are youth knowledge and attitudes (KA) about cannabis
structured by social interactions and by outside information?

2. How are knowledge and attitudes affecting and affected by cannabis
consumption?

3. How are these processes affected by the changing legal situation?

# Method

- This is a prioneer study:  prospect study 2018, 2019 and 2020 cohort comparison
- questionnaire design:  survyes and focus groups
- sample collection
-- Who: high school students grade 6-12 (middle school and high school) (also parents and teachers?)
-- Where:  Hamilton Ontario school distrcit (random selection vs. purposeful selection)

* a side mark:  we may be able to work on network theory and norm from the data.
